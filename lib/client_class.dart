// - the actual price that the client should pay,
// - a bool of wether the counter is launched for him
// - the latitude and the longitude of his actual position
// - the latitude and the longitude of his previous location
// - the second's counter that verifies when to check the user's location
// - the function that starts the countdown and resets it.
